                <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">The Bulletin is your central hub for finding opportunities. It's designed to be powerful yet simple to use.</p>
                
<h3 className={`${typography.h3} text-foreground mt-5 mb-2`}>AI-Powered Search</h3>
                <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">The most powerful feature of the Bulletin is the AI search bar. Simply type what you're thinking in natural language, and the system will understand your intent.</p>
                
                <PlaceholderImage text="Screenshot: AI Search Bar & Results" />

                    <li><strong>If you want to join a project:</strong> Try searching for something like, <strong className="text-foreground">"I want to help on a project using Python and Data Science."</strong> The AI will find relevant "Help Wanted" posts and initiatives looking for those skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>If you want to build a new project:</strong> Describe your idea, like <strong className="text-foreground">"I have an idea for a mobile app that helps new hires onboard."</strong> The AI will first find similar existing projects to prevent duplication. If none exist, it will offer to pre-fill a new initiative form for you based on your idea!</li>
                </ul>

<h3 className={`${typography.h3} text-foreground mt-5 mb-2`}>Browsing & Filtering</h3>
                 <p className="text-muted-foreground">Below the search, you can browse all initiatives, which are organized into tabs by their status (e.g., 'Searching Talent', 'In Progress'). You can use the filter buttons to narrow down the list by location, skills, or tags.</p>
